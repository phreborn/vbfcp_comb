1)copy the to-be-combined workspaces into inWS/
- source prepareInWS.sh 

1a)to produce alternative Asimov datas
- for tau channel, use genAsiTau.sh
- for gam channel, use genAsiGam.sh

next steps need to set configurations in ./config.py first
2)preparing list of syst in both channels:
- python sysList_yy.py => yy_sysList.txt
- root -b -q readTauWS.cxx => tautau_globList.txt tautau_npList.txt

3)create combination xml files:
- python makeXml.py -d ${dpoint} (use makeXml.sh for all tilde_d points)

4)create combined workspaces in condor mode:
- use genCombWS.sh

5)fit the combined workspaces in condor mode:
- use genHepsub.sh
